# Under construction

__THIS MODULE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION__


## Verifyjs

A simple way to verify parameters in typescript / javascript


## Development

``npm run init`` - Setup the module for development (run once after cloning)

``npm run dev`` - Run this command when you want to work on this module. It will compile typescript, run tests and watch for file changes.

## Distribution

``npm run build -- -v <version>`` - Create a distribution build of the module.

__-v (version)__ - _[Optional]_ Either "patch", "minor" or "major". Increase the version number in the package.json file.

The build command creates a _/compiled_ directory which has all the javascript compiled code and typescript definitions. As well, a _/dist_ directory is created that contains a minified javascript file.

## Testing

_Tests are automatically ran when you do a build._

``npm run test`` - Run the tests. The tests will be ran in a nodejs environment. You can run the tests in a browser environment by opening the file  _/spec/in-browser/SpecRunner.html_.
